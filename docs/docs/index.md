# Dyve

Dyve is a vendor-agnostic unified interface for all your platforms, CI and monitoring tools. In its basic form, Dyve allows platform operators to bundle their used tools into one solution, providing a great developer experience to their teams. Dyve is fully extensible for more complex use-cases or tools that are not yet supported out of the box.

## Concept

The following illustrates the high-level architecture of dyve. The core and frontend application are the main building blocks of dyve. The core application fetches data from many different platforms and tools by using domain specific provider apps.
