# Dyve

Dyve is a vendor-agnostic unified interface for all your platforms, CI and monitoring tools. In its basic form, Dyve allows platform operators to bundle their used tools into one solution, providing a great developer experience to their teams. Dyve is fully extensible for more complex use-cases or tools that are not yet supported out of the box.
